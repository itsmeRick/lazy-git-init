# lazy-git-init
One script to make a project directory and all related git initializations


I only wrote this to work on my laptop running Arch Linux... <3

Need to create a .env file as this script uses python-dotenv to load your github credentials and project paths

Installation
------------------
```
$ git clone "https://github.com/itsmeRick/lazy-git-init.git"
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

.env File Format
------------------
```
USERNAME="your-username"
PASSWORD="your-password"
FILEPATH="/your/project/path"
```
